* Jupyter on the Cluster
** First open an interactive session on the cluster:   

   srun -p test --pty --mem 500 -t 0-06:00 /bin/bash
   will start a command line shell (/bin/bash) on the test queue with 500 MB of RAM for 6 hours; 1 core on 1 node is assumed as these parameters (-n 1 -N 1) were left out. When the interactive session starts, you will notice that you are no longer on a login node, but rather one of the compute nodes dedicated to this queue. The --pty option allows the session to act like a standard terminal.
srun -p test --pty --x11 --mem 4000 -t 0-06:00 /bin/bash

   The 4000 is the amount of memory requested, the 300 is the
